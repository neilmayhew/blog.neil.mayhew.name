Today I found my silver cuff-links. These were a present from my uncle for my 21st birthday, and very precious to me. I thought they were gone forever.

Now I appreciate *The Parable of the Lost Coin* much more deeply:

> In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.
> [Luke 15:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2015:8-10;&amp;version=31;")

God rejoices over me like I am rejoicing now. [Amazing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Grace)<!-- title: Amazing Grace -->, and beautiful.
