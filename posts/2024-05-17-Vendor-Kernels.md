I've always hated "vendor kernels" â€” vendor-specific versions of the Linux kernel that use an old kernel version with many backported fixes. Red Hat is one of the best-known examples. Finally, someone did a thorough study of why this is a bad idea, and the situation is even worse than I'd thought. Far from being "more stable", they are downright dangerous and a drag on the industry.
