title: About Me
---

I'm a senior software engineer, experienced in designing and developing server, desktop and embedded applications on Linux and Mac OS. I enjoy architecting complex systems, developing new algorithms, designing for efficiency/footprint/performance, and planning for code robustness and low maintenance from the outset.

I've also led and managed projects for many years. I enjoy bringing out the best in each team member, and creating a team ethos in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

I work on Linux and Mac platforms, using mainly Haskell, C++, Python and XSLT.
